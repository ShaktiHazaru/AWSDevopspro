To start with code Build, below 5 are necessary.

1. Create an IAM role for CodeDeploy with S3ReadOnlyAccess.
2. Create an IAM role for EC2 with S3ReadOnlyAccess. 
3. Launch EC2 instance with appropriate EC2 role.
4. Install CodeDeploy agent in EC2. 
5. Configure CodeDeploy service. 

ssh command from mac to aws ubuntu machine

chmod 400 abc.pem
ssh -i abc.pem ubuntu@public-ip-address 


Follow the documentation to Deploy codedeploy agent on ubuntu, 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-ubuntu.html

for linux:

 AWS CodeDeploy Agent Installation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-linux.html


Once done, create the code deploy application, deployment group and then the deployment. 

Imp: 
-----
We need to zip the appspec.yml and script file and load it in the s3 bucket for codedeploy agent to pickup and provide the location details in the deployment.  


**** please note **** ***************************************************************

Dont zip the files by creating a folder and place the appsec.yml and scripts folder.
Rather zip appsec.yml and other files and create a folder. 

otherwise, we'll get below error.
BeforeInstall   0 seconds  Failed  UnknownError

Always check the logs on the host under path /var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent 

"The CodeDeploy agent did not find an AppSpec file within the unpacked revision directory at revision-relative path \\\"appspec.yml\\\"
