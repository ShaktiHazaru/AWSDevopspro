AWS code build:

"AWS code commit" is no longer available for new users, so we have to connect to third party source repositories such as git to fetch the source code and to build. 

1. On console type Code Build -> create project.

2. Enter project name.
3. Choose GitHub from the primary source drop down. 
4. Enter the reposotiry details, fill all rest of the details.



So, When I was running my codebuild, it was trying to fetch the source by connecting to github, but I was getting below error.

CLIENT_ERROR: Failed to get access token from arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:783764610763:connection/d0029bce-f9c7-4c76-860f-ac5f4c5bcd46: 
Access denied to connection arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:783764610763:connection/d0029bce-f9c7-4c76-860f-ac5f4c5bcd46

To resolve the above issue 
a. Go to IAM -> Roles -> Find the role which is used by the code Build 
b. Click on ADD permissions
c. Create inline policy
d. type codestarconnections and select all read permissions and click on next
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "codestar-connections:GetHost",
                "codestar-connections:GetRepositoryLink",
                "codestar-connections:GetInstallationUrl",
                "codestar-connections:GetConnection",
                "codestar-connections:GetIndividualAccessToken",
                "codestar-connections:GetSyncConfiguration",
                "codestar-connections:GetSyncBlockerSummary",
                "codestar-connections:UseConnection",
                "codestar-connections:GetConnectionToken",
                "codestar-connections:PassRepository",
                "codestar-connections:GetResourceSyncStatus",
                "codestar-connections:StartOAuthHandshake",
                "codestar-connections:GetRepositorySyncStatus",
                "codestar-connections:StartAppRegistrationHandshake",
                "codestar-connections:RegisterAppCode",
                "codestar-connections:PassConnection"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

e. Add the policy name and save. 

5. In the build spec  we need to give below commands.
As this is a simple C++ project, we used below.

C++ source code will be stored with .cpp extension.

version: 0.2

phases:
  build:
    commands:
       - g++ hello-world.cpp -o hello-world
artifacts:
  files:
   - 'hello-world' 

To validate: 
we can validate the s3 bucket to check if the articrafts are stored after build is complete.
